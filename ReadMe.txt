Consumer Loan Assistant Project Four text field controls are used for inputs and a large text area is used to present the loan
analysis results.
The loan assistant appears as:

<br>
In this initial configuration, you enter a Loan Balance, an Interest Rate (annual rate as a
percentage) and a Number of Payments value. Click Compute Monthly Payment. The payment
will appear in the ‘yellow’ text field and a complete loan analysis will appear in the large text
field. Here are some numbers I tried:

<br>
So, if I borrow $30,000 at 5.5% interest, I will pay $822.56 for three years and 4 months (40 months). More
specific details on exact payment amounts, including total interest paid, is shown under Loan
Analysis.
At this point, you can click New Loan Analysis to try some new values:

<br>
Note the Loan Balance, Interest Rate, and Number of Payments entries remain. Only the
Monthly Payment and the Loan Analysis have been cleared. This lets you try different values
with minimal typing of new entries. Change any entry you like to see different results – or even
change them all. Try as many combinations as you like.
At some point, clear the text fields and click the button with an X next to the Number of Payments
text field. You will see:

Notice the Number of Payments box is now yellow. The button with an X has moved to the
Monthly Payment text field. In this configuration, you enter a Loan Balance, an Interest Rate
and a Monthly Payment. The loan assistant will determine how many payments you need to pay
off the loan. Here are some numbers I tried

It will take 1230 payments (the last one is smaller) to pay off this particular loan. Again, you can
click New Loan Analysis to try other values and see the results.
